Ideally, work on three separate batches of content. \n\nIdea 1: How to Onboard to Solana\nEasy-to-consume videos about bridging to Solana from the first to the last step. For more info, Click here:\n- Bridge from major TVL DeFi chains (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and Tron)\n- Withdraw to Solana from major CEXs (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)\n- Focus on Phantom and Backpack (especially Backpack for Ethereum)\n- Swapping bridged assets on Jupiter\nIn addition to the videos, there will be written content with step-by-step instructions using screenshots from the video. You can create videos using Loom to show the basic steps.\nIdea 2: How To - Hubble and Kamino\nVideos showing users how to use:\n- https://app.hubbleprotocol.io/\n- https://app.kamino.finance/\nThe video team will be provided with scripts and Loom recordings to show the steps necessary. Similar to the “How to Onboard to Solana” videos, they need something that is easy to follow, engaging, and slick.\nHow to deposit, withdraw, participate in Stability Vault, stake HBB, manage account, which Kamino vaults to use and when etc.\nThe goal is to incorporate these videos into the dApp with tooltips and would require the videos to be evergreen.\nIdea 3: Concentrated Liquidity\nVideo series focusing on concentrated liquidity, similar to these CLOB explainer videos from Serum: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSnqhLQ6tY0 These videos may require some extra animation or graphics to better explain some concepts visually. The Hubble team can provide many of the graphics and you can leverage their design team.\n- What is concentrated liquidity?\n- What are the advantages of concentrated liquidity?\n- Why provide concentrated liquidity?\n- When to provide liquidity (timing for different asset types).\n\nScope of Work:\nHubble needs a talented video producer to create multiple video tutorials that are sleek and professional looking for maximum shareability in the ecosystem.\nVoiceover needs to be clear and needs to have the pronunciation and intonation of a native-speaker.\n\nIdeal Candidate:\n- Has experience creating educational video content, voiceovers & tutorials.\n- Can produce quality content.\n- Can create custom motion graphics and animations using stock footage ( Hubble design team available for help )\n\nMission Screening Questions:\nTo apply for this Mission, you’ll first need to put together a lightweight plan. This plan should answer the following strategic questions:\n1. What are potentially the most difficult parts of the project?\n2. What, if anything, will you need from the sponsor team (besides funding)?\n3. What are your best examples of proof of work?\n\nPut the answers into a Google doc to include in your application. Please make sure your visibility settings are set to “Anyone with the link” or your application will not be reviewed.\n\nNote: you are free to work on this project with a small team if you’d like.

    "description": "About the Bounty\nGrants are part of the lifeblood of crypto projects in 2023. Given by foundations, protocols, and organizations across the Solana ecosystem, grants are equity-free funding avenues to help builders create valuable products.\nHere’s the problem: there are more grant programs than any one person could reasonably find. Builders are missing out on “free” money, simply because of a lack of awareness. Making things even worse, each grant program has different objectives, requirements, and focuses. Trying to figure out which grant program to apply for can be confusing and time-consuming for builders.\nSuperteam is sponsoring a bounty to fix this problem. While it isn’t exactly clear what the solution should look like, here is a rough user journey to inspire you as you build:\n1. Users come to the Grantfinder website.\n2. They describe their project in natural language, possibly using a form.\n3. The form then evaluates their responses. This may be done with a GPT model, or perhaps will be done with simple if/then statements on the backend.\n4. Based on the responses, the website shows the builder which grants they are eligible for, along with links to apply for the grants.\n\nThis simple tool can be built in a weekend but potentially change the trajectory of builders around the world - we can’t wait to see what you build!\n\nSend Us Your Bounty Submission\n\nYour Mission: Create a website that allows builders to find relevant grants for their projects. Teams of up to 3 people can participate in this bounty.  \n\nRewards\n🥇 First Prize\n- $1500 USDC\n- Member status in Superteam\n\n🥈 Second Prize\n- $500 USDC\n- Member status in Superteam\n\nEvaluation Criteria\nFunctionality \n- Does your project have a clean and simple-to-use UI?\n- Does your project include all grant programs available for Solana and cross-chain projects?\n- Does your project give accurate suggestions to builders on which grant programs to apply to?\n\nSubmission Requirements\n- A functional website that builders can use to find relevant grant programs\n- The website should be accessible at the time of submission\n- The submission link should be the URL of the website\n\nResources\n- Superteam Instagrants\n- Blockworks Grant Directory\n- Bounty Programme FAQ\n- For any questions, DM @pratikdholani on Twitter or @pratikd#5848 in Superteam’s Discord\n\nDeadline: April 26, 2023; 11:59 PM (Indian Standard Time)\n\nParticipation in this bounty is entirely voluntary.

    "description": "Bounty Description\n\nAmulet is the first insurance protocol for the Rust ecosystem, starting with Solana. They are built as a flexible protocol enabling them to provide many different type of insurance products. Some of their initial insurance products are:\n\n- Smart Contract Risk\n- Stablecoin de-peg Risk\n\nAmulet has designed an innovative and open insurance model, which not only effectively addresses the common challenges of existing decentralized insurance protocols, but also creates a new paradigm shift for the whole insurance sector. \n\nWhat is unique about Amulet\n\nAll traditional and DeFi insurance  protocols attack staked / invested funds in order to pay out claims, this diminishes returns and impacts relationships creating an unsustainable model. Amulets unique structure enables them to pay out claims without impacting staked capital.\n\nEnabled by Solana they have designed Protocol-Controlled Underwriting (PCU).\n\nThe PCUutilses a proof of stake validator and other methods to generate yields. These Yields are tokenised into their future yield pool creating layers of protection between a claim and your staked assets. Meaning they can always payout claims whilst generating significant yields for stakers.\n\nCurrent state\nTheir testnet is functional, but not very intuitive. They have docs, etc., in place but need an extra community review.\n\nBounty goals\nReview their documentation, analyze their user flows and interaction.\nThe ultimate aims for Amulet is to make it easy for users to understand the platform and its benefits, and the number of clicks required to purchase, without compromising on use experience.\n\nThe result of this bounty will be included in their next release.",

    "description": "Deadline: December 20th, 11:59pm IST\nAbout the Bounty\nSeveral new Layer1 blockchains have emerged in recent years. Each attempt to fulfil different gaps in the market, address different needs and attack the blockchain trilemma from very different angles of speed, scalability & fees. These L1s quickly grew in popularity and gained a lot of attention at the top of the bull run.\n\nWhere do they stand today?\nThis bounty requires a detailed research report on the comparative performance of various L1s in terms of the following metrics. Each metric has a few guiding questions, but they are just illustrative in nature, so please do not limit the research just to answering those.\n- Dev growth: How have their developer ecosystems grown? How easy is it for new developers to get started shipping? What global community efforts have they undertaken, are they effective? What is the best estimate of the current number of active developers and their growth over time? (explain your methodology with links to public sources and state assumptions)\n- Project adoption & growth: Are projects actually being built on it? How many? Please qualify the stage of development and usage metrics (announcements are great but they are not projects). The classification/hierarchy should be along the lines of\n    - products on main-net with actual users that anyone can use\n    - products on main-net in closed beta\n    - products on test/dev net\n- Please include public estimates of actual user counts from sources like dApp Radar or equivalent. Be mindful of separating vanilla signing/voting messages from actual user actions.\n- Geographic growth: Which geographies have they focussed their efforts on, and which ones have they missed out on? What is their geographical stronghold? What is their launch strategy for these new markets?\n- Unique use cases: Is the L1 focussed on any particular kinds of use cases? What use cases are they ideally best suited for? Are they leveraging some of these strengths properly? Is there some technical innovation/differentiation/trade-off that\n- Wins/fails in the last 1 year: How would you analyse their performance overall in the last 1 year? What are the hits and misses?\n- List of suggestions for each: What would be your top recommendations to them across each of the aspects researched?\n \nYour Mission\nBecome an expert on some of the most prominent L1s and write a detailed report addressing all of the above-mentioned points and more.

Advanced zero-knowledge cryptography is the backbone of the Elusiv protocol. The protocol utilizes this cryptographic primitive for both encrypted transactions and privacy-preserving decentralized compliance solutions empowering both user and network. Builders and developers can also use Elusiv’s SDK to enable existing applications like wallets, DeFi protocols, payment solutions, and more to efficiently implement zero-knowledge technology.\nAs privacy remains a complex problem for crypto, Elusiv’s comprehensive approach will enable new and existing applications to overcome this challenge without compromise. This marks the end of privacy and compliance being mutually exclusive, paving the way for mainstream crypto adoption.\nElusiv is sponsoring a bounty for participants to write a deep dive on the protocol, highlighting the following:\n- Elusiv’s architecture\n- All of Elusiv’s features\n- Practical use cases for Elusiv\n- Bonus points for highlighting how Elusiv is uniquely positioned in the Web3 privacy space (i.e., Elusiv’s differentiating factors when compared to other privacy projects)\n\nSend Us Your Bounty Submission\n\nYour Mission: Become a master of Elusiv and consolidate your expertise into a written essay.\n\nRewards\n🥇 First Prize\n- $500 USDC\n- Member status in Superteam\n- Syndication in Superteam’s newsletter\n\n🥈 Second Prize\n- $200 USDC\n- Contributor status in Superteam\n\n🥉 Third Prize\n- $100 USDC\n- Contributor status in Superteam\n\nEvaluation Criteria\n\nDepth\n- Did you explore the background of the project?\n- Does your essay talk about the key features of the project?\n- Is your essay the one-stop resource for people to get up to speed with this project?\n- Did you learn everything there is to know about the project?\n- Did you take screenshots, provide a step-by-step guide to onboarding, and clearly articulate the value the project offers?\n- Did you bring context to the necessity of privacy?\n- Did you identify practical use cases for Elusiv?\n\nWriting Style\n- Did you write a compelling introduction and a satisfying conclusion?\n- Is your writing easy and fun to read?\n- Did you avoid overly complex jargon?\n- Is your essay free from grammatical errors?\n- Is the title eye-catching?\n- Did you integrate links to resources and helpful content seamlessly for contextual purposes (blogs, docs, other media outlets)?\n- Did you explain concepts in a way a person new to crypto could understand?\n\nSubmission Requirements\n- Did you write your essay in English?\n- Is your submission at least 1,000 words?

It includes basic tutorials for trying out a handful of well-known Solana projects across categories such as wallets, NFT marketplaces, DeFi, etc.\nThe Superteam community appreciates this project for its unintimidating and fun-to-read style of introducing newcomers to the power of Solana. To double down on it, Superteam is sponsoring a bounty to increase the number of guides included on the Solana Tourism website.\nNote:\n- The submission should include guides for Solana projects only. More specifically, they should be consumer-facing projects which anyone with a wallet can interact with\n- The submissions will be in an article format (ie google doc, notion, etc.) and will include three main sections - a) project logo and 1-2 liner intro; b) up to two paragraphs on the concept (for example, intro to NFTs mentioned in the Magic Eden section on Solana Tourism); c) the guide, including the sub-sections “things to do here” and “steps”\n    - Essentially, emulate the current format used in the Solana Tourism website, such that submissions can be directly “plugged in”. This means taking care of the word count, size of the sections, writing style, etc.\n- In case of a tie where submissions contain the same project, the better-worded submission will be chosen as the winner. In other words, aim for a submission which can be best “plugged in”, which doesn’t much effort or editing from our end\n\nSend Us Your Bounty Submission\n\nYour Mission: Submit guides to be plugged into the Solana Tourism website.\n\nRewards\n🥇 Selected Guides\n- $200 USDC per selected guide (max 5 guides to be selected; total reward pool of $1,000 USDC)\n- Contributor Status in Superteam\n- Syndication in our newsletter and social media\n\nEvaluation Criteria\n\nDepth & Clarity\n- Did you explore the background of the project?\n- Is your guide easy and fun to read?\n- Did you avoid jargon, and explain concepts in a manner that a newcomer would understand?\n- Did you choose a compelling consumer-facing project?\n- Is your guide articulated well, and in the required style of the current guides on Solana Tourism?\n\nSubmission Requirements\n- Did you write your submission in English?\n- Is your guide within 400 words?

    "description": "About the Bounty\nWormhole is a decentralized, universal message-passing protocol that connects to multiple blockchains. In simple terms Wormhole allows different blockchains to communicate with each other. It addresses two of the main problems that plague blockchains today:\n\n- Tokens are hard to move between blockchains without relying on centralized exchanges for bridging and swapping tokens. However, this means users are subject to counterparty risk.\n- Decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts on different blockchains cannot communicate with each other, making interoperability between chains difficult to achieve.\n\nWormhole solves this by monitoring several chains for messages emitted by smart contracts on those chains. This is achieved through the Wormhole Core Layer & enables cross-chain communication protocols like token and NFT bridges, cross-chain oracles and other messaging applications that would not operate without Wormhole's infrastructure. \n\nYour Mission: Become an expert on Wormhole and summarise your findings in a written essay. Highlight projects that are using wormhole today & explain the impact of cross-chain capabilities on their product/protocol. Include ideas of existing projects or potential use cases that can be improved with wormhole’s suite of cross-chain capabilities. Summarise the competitive landscape including threat & opportunities for Wormhole.\nYou're welcome to write this review individually or in teams of 2.

    "description": "About the Bounty\nSwitchboard is a decentralized oracle network that empowers developers to own and configure their own data feeds. Web3 developers rely on real-world data in their applications but blockchains have no way to pull data from external sources. Oracles solve this problem by residing between a blockchain and the internet and facilitate the flow of information for developers to consume downstream.\nMost people associate oracles with a price feed but Switchboard took a more generic approach; Switchboard can route any on or off chain data source such as prices, sport results, weather information, or the number of followers Elon Musk has on twitter. Switchboard believes this generic approach to sourcing data will open the door to new web3 applications that were previously out of reach.\nThe internet is a vast place and sourcing public data can be challenging and time consuming. The Switchboard publisher aims to solve this problem by building a decentralized data catalog where users can contribute job definitions and receive a portion of the protocol fees if a developer builds and funds an on-chain feed (“Democratizing Data”).\nSwitchboard is looking to the Superteam to perform a deep dive on Switchboard data feeds, explain the various data feed configuration parameters, and provide a general walkthrough of the publisher. By the end, a reader should have a fundamental understanding of Switchboard data feeds and have the ability to publish their own custom data feed.\n\n🎯\nYour Mission: Become an expert on Switchboard and summarize your findings in a written essay. \n\nYou're welcome to write this review individually or in teams of 2.

    "description": "About the Bounty\nAmulet is the first insurance protocol for the Rust ecosystem, starting with Solana. They are built as a flexible protocol enabling them to provide many different type of insurance products. Some of their initial insurance products are:\n- Smart Contract Risk\n- Stablecoin de-peg Risk\n\nAmulet has designed an innovative and open insurance model, which not only effectively addresses the common challenges of existing decentralized insurance protocols, but also creates a new paradigm shift for the whole insurance sector. \n\nWhat is unique about Amulet\nAll traditional and DeFi insurance  protocols attack staked / invested funds in order to pay out claims, this diminishes returns and impacts relationships creating an unsustainable model. Amulets unique structure enables them to pay out claims without impacting staked capital.\n\nEnabled by Solana they have designed Protocol-Controlled Underwriting (PCU).\nThe PCUutilses a proof of stake validator and other methods to generate yields. These Yields are tokenised into their future yield pool creating layers of protection between a claim and your staked assets. Meaning they can always payout claims whilst generating significant yields for stakers.\n\nCurrent state\nTheir testnet is functional, but not very intuitive. They have docs, etc., in place but need an extra community review.\n\nBounty goals\n- Review their documentation, analyze their user flows and interaction.\n- The ultimate aims for Amulet is to make it easy for users to understand the platform and its benefits, and the number of clicks required to purchase, without compromising on use experience.\n\nThe result of this bounty will be included in their next release.\n\n🎯\nYour Goal: Conduct a thorough UI/UX review for Amulet that matches this example in quality. You're welcome to complete this review individually or in teams of 2. Bounties will be split among team members.\nRewards\n\n🥇 First Prize: \n- $2500 USDC\n- Membership in Superteam\n- Syndication on our social media \n\n🥈 Second Prize\n- $500 USDC\n- Contributor role in Superteam\n\n🥉 Third Prize\n- $250 USDC\n- Contributor role in Superteam\n\nEvaluation Criteria\n\n- Depth\n    - Did you identify problems for each screen you examined?\n    - Did you explain what the user goals are for the different areas of the product you're reviewing?\n    - Did you include screenshots of the existing designs?\n    - Did you create a new design that solves the problems you identified?\n    - Did you package your review into a nice presentation (e.g. Notion, Google Slides, Figma, etc.)?\n\n- Submission Requirements\n    - Share your submission on Twitter & tag @superteamdao + @Amulet & use the hashtag #Superteambounty and submit this link in your bounty application.\n\nResources\n- Amulet Website\n- Amulet Blog\n- Amulet Testnet\n- Amulet Discord\n- For any questions, DM @Abbasshaikh42 on Twitter or @abbas in our Discord\n",

    "slug": "hubble-protocol-deep-dive",
    "description": "About the Bounty\nHubble Protocol is on a mission to supercharge liquidity on Solana. It gives users the opportunity to access the capital trapped in their HODLed tokens, and the protocol allows users to earn yield while they borrow at extremely capital-efficient rates.\nHubble Protocol plans three initial phases of development as the project works to expand the number of DeFi 2.0 services on Solana. Hubble’s first phase centers on zero-interest multi-asset borrowing and the minting of USDH, a Solana-native 100% decentralized crypto-backed stablecoin. Phase 2 focuses on structured products, while Phase 3 focuses on undercollateralized lending.\nAs more users begin their DeFi journey on Hubble, and as Hubble continues developing into a stable protocol, it will one day fully decentralize into a DAO with community governance, making the protocol 100% democratically organized.\n\nThe winning submission will talk about the various features  of Hubble and provide a detailed breakdown.\n\n🎯\nYour Mission: Become an expert on Hubble Protocol and summarize your findings in a written essay. You're welcome to write this review individually or in teams of 2. Bounties will be split among team members.\nRewards\n\n🥇 First Prize:\n- $500 SOLR\n- Membership in Superteam\n- Syndication in our newsletter and social media\n\n🥈 Second Prize:\n- $300 SOLR\n\n🥉 Third Prize:\n- $200 SOLR\nEvaluation Criteria\n\n- Depth\n    - Did you explore the background of Hubble Protocol?\n    - Did you talk about all the key features of Hubble?\n    - Is your essay the one-stop-resource for people to get up to speed with this project?\n    - Did you join their Discord and get a feel for the community?\n\n- Writing Style\n    - Did you write a compelling introduction and a satisfying conclusion?\n    - Is your writing easy and fun to read?\n    - Did you avoid overly complex jargon?\n    - Did you explain concepts in a way a person new to crypto could understand?\n\nCheck out previous bounty winners to get a sense of the quality we expect.\n\nResources\n- Hubble Devnet\n- Hubble Medium\n- Hubble Substack\n- Hubble Twitter\n- Hubble Blog\n\n\nFor any questions, DM @abbasshaikh42 on Twitter or @abbasshaikh in our Discord\n",

        Nice work! Your submission for {bountyName} has been received. Pour
        yourself a glass of something tasty - youâ€™ve earned it ðŸ¥³

        Once the deadline passes, youâ€™ll be able to see all the other
        submissions on the bounty page. Weâ€™ll then send you an email once the
        winners (hopefully including you!) are announced.
